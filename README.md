# Video Game Sales Analysis

Nowadays, video games play a major role in many parts of our lives. It helps us destress, improves our social skills, enhances our memory and cognitive abilities, and makes us more productive. Team GameStop investigated global video sales to take a deeper look into the data and underlying information. Our article can be found (ADD LINK LATERs).

The dataset containes the following entires:
* `RANK` - Ranking of overall sales
* `NAME` - Name of the game
* `GENRE` - Genre of the game
* `ESRB_RATING` - ESRB Rating of the game
* `PLATFORM` - Platform of the game (i.e. PC, PS4, XOne, etc.)
* `PUBLISHER` - Publisher of the game
* `DEVELOPER` - Developer of the game
* `CRITIC_SCORE` - Critic score of the game from 10
* `USER_SCORE` - Users score the game from 10
* `TOTAL_SHIPPED` - Total shipped copies of the game
* `Global_Sales` - Total worldwide sales (in millions)
* `NA_SALE` - Sales in North America (in millions)
* `PAL_SALE` - Sales in Europe (in millions)
* `JP_SALE` - Sales in Japan (in millions)

# Data Processing
Different data preprocessing approch were used for different visualizations. Overall, the basic steps we performed overlaps. For each visualization, we dropped the unrelated columns, and imputed missing values in the remaining columns with approaches such as dropping NaN rows, imputing missing values with mean, median, or mode. 

# Analysis and Code
Our analysis and code can be found in the the [analysis folder](https://github.com/datares/gamestop/tree/main/Analysis). We utilized various python libraries to create our visulizations and model creation. For visulizations, some of the package we used includes matplotlib, seaborn, plot.ly. And for building the machine learning model, we primarily used sklearn. We split the dataset into training and testing patches. We fitted different ML models such as regression models and knn. We then performed cross validation to check accuracy of our model. 

## Research Questions
### What are the popular genre
The first question we investigated was the popularity of genres. We answered this question different visualizations by examining total sales by genre, total sales by different genre published, as well as total sales by genre by region.
